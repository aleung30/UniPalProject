# The Vision Behind UniPal

Do you often feel overwhelmed by the stress and challenges of university, yet struggle to manage the emotional rollercoaster? Have you ever wondered how your mood fluctuates as you undergo the pressures of post-secondary? With *UniPal*, users will be able to add and view accomplishments in their *Accomplishment Collection*, add and view moods in their *Mood Collection*, keep track of previously logged mood names, and receive personalized recommendations for relaxation methods based on mood type.

As a second-year university student, I have noticed that many of my peers, including myself, have struggled with adjusting to post-secondary. Thus, the main users of this application will be **university students**, who want to track and reflect on their mental well-being over the course of the semesters. By providing a tool to help fellow students navigate this transition, we can promote open conversations about mental health and help reduce the stigma surrounding it.
